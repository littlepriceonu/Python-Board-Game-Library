~Todo: Make basic WASD movement built in (Already have a file with all the code, I just have to implment it)~

Todo: Upgrade File Saving. Like saving certain positions in a special part of the file so it can be set back (I.e. say you have the players position saved and want it so when they load there save the game still knows where they are. I want the function to return a table of positions in a certain order.

Todo: Make It So You Can Pick The Default "Empty Cell" (i.e. you can change the default "0-0" to something else)
